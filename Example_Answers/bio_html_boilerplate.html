        <!-- Exercise 1: Discuss what the DOCTYPE is used for and why html needs it. --> 
        DOCTYPE tells the computer compiler which language is being used and to recognize everything following it as html.
        If this is not specified, html will not run.

        <!-- Exercise 2: What is a html tag? -->
        An html tag has an two pointed brackets around a key word that tells the programmer where things belong or what
        they will do in relation to the code. For example, "<html></html>" tag is used to state that html will follow.
       
        <!-- Exercise 3: What is an opening and closing tag and how are they used? What happens if you forget a closing tag? -->
        Like "<html>" and "</html>" most tags must be closed in order to move onto another tag's properties. It is as if 
        the opening tag is a faucet turn knob for ON and you would like to receive water. In order to receive the water,
        you must turn the knob ON. In order to conclude receiving water, you must turn the OFF knob, which is much like 
        the closing tag.
        
        <!-- Exercise 4: What is the difference between a <head> tag and a <body> tag? -->
        The head tag contains non visual information about the page, for the internet browser to use. The body tag contains
        the information that will be provided to the user.
       
        <!-- Exercise 5: Where can you title your page? -->
        In the head tag, using the title tags.
        
        <!-- Exercise 6: Where does the page content (what you will see on the webpage) belong in the boilerplate? Name the tag.-->
        The page content goes in the body tag.
